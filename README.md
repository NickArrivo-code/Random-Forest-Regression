# Random-Forest-Regression
Random Forest Regression Model of Fastball Data. Predicting how likely a ball is to be put in play based on pitch metrics. I like the applications of this model for scouting, player development, and making in game adjustments.

I added plots to display the importance of each pitch metric and impact of location on pitch whiff potential.
